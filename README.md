# Roblox ID Grabber
## hey-o this thing saves you time getting roblox ids from the catalog or library



This is a chrome extension I made so you can save time getting ids on roblox.
You install it by saving as zip, unzipping the zip somewhere, going into chrome's extension menu, enabling developer mode, clicking "Load unpacked", and selecting the "robloxidgetter" folder.
You use it by simply clicking the extension icon while on the item page.

This is an unpacked extension that requires developer mode simply because I can't get a chrome dev account.

I'm not *entirely* sure on if this works on other browsers, so try that at your own risk.

Signed, teith.
